# Each project has an alternative:

- *a) To fill in the description [below](https://github.com/ai-robotics-estonia/_project_template_/edit/main/README.md#implementation-details)*
*Tiksoja Puidugrupp manufactures furniture for children and adults. The company's product range includes around 1000 products sold to large B2B buyers all over Europe
The goal of this project is to develop an (artificial intelligence-based) solution - an expert system that allows automating the creation of a route, recipe and BoM, and later creating an ERP entry based on them.
*
- *c) a custom agreement with the AIRE team*

## Objectives of the Demonstration Project
*Artificial intelligence-based solution - expert system for automating the creation of the production routes with operational times.*


## Activities and results of demonstration project
*Challenge addressed (i.e. whether and how the initial challenge was changed during the project, for which investment the demonstration project was provided)*
- a) The modification of todays working routine in product design process to provide Input parameters required for Product Management Information (PMI) generation.
- b) Implementation of standard features library
- c) The development of algorithm required for production route generation. (Non written rules)
- d) The quality of data for AI model training.
- e) The validity of created alternative production routes*



*Data sources (which data was used for the technological solution)*
-  *a)   *

*Description and justifictaion of used AI technology*
-  *a)*

*Results of testing and validating technological solution*
-  *a)*

*Technical architecture (presented graphically, where can also be seen how the technical solution integrates with the existing system)*
-  *a)*

*Potential areas of use of technical solution*
-  *a)*

*Lessons learned (i.e. assessment whether the technological solution actually solved the initial challenge)*
-  *a)*

### Description of User Interface 
*(i.e. How does the client 'see' the technical result, whether a separate user interface was developed, command line script was developed, was it validated as an experiment, can the results be seen in ERP or are they integrated into work process)*
-  *a)*


## Custom agreement with the AIRE team

*If you have a unique project or specific requirements that don't fit neatly into the Docker file or description template options, we welcome custom agreements with our AIRE team. This option allows flexibility in collaborating with us to ensure your project's needs are met effectively.*

*To explore this option, please contact our demonstration projects service manager via katre.eljas@taltech.ee with the subject line "Demonstration Project Custom Agreement Request - [Your Project Name]." In your email, briefly describe your project and your specific documentation or collaboration needs. Our team will promptly respond to initiate a conversation about tailoring a solution that aligns with your project goals.*
